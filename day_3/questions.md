## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples. __A conditional statement is a statement that returns a value of true or false and then takes an action based off that. Conditional statements can look like:__
  - `==` asks if the object on the left is _equal_ to the object on the right
  - `>` is the object on the left _greater_ than the object on the right
  - `>=` is the object on the left _greater than or equal to_ the object on the right

1. Why might you want to use an if-statement? __You might want to use an if-statement if there are different branches your program can take based off what the user inputs or what certain values are.__

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?
```
if [condition]
  [perform this action if condition is true]
end
```

1. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement? __You can add multiple conditions to an if statement using the `elsif` and `else` function.__

1. What is the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement?
```
if [condition 1]
  [perform this action if condition 1 is true]
elsif [condition 2]
  [perform this action if condition 2 is true]
else
  [perform this action if neither condition 1 nor 2 are true]
end
```

1. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement? __Conditional statements are useful when you are looking for a true or false response. They can be used in arrays using the `.include?` method to search through the array and see if a particular value exists in that array.__
