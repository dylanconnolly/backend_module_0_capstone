## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a method? __a method is useful when you want to execute a piece of code many times. Rather than writing a sentence or response multiple times, you can include this in a method so that whenever that method is called, it prints that response.__

1. In the space below, create a method named `hello` that will print `"Sam I am"`.
```
def hello
  puts "Sam I am"
end
```

1. Create a method name `hello_someone` that takes an argument of `name` and prints `"#{name} I am"`.
```
def hello_someone(name)
  puts "#{name} I am"
end
```

1. How would you call or execute the method that you created above?
```
hello_someone(Dylan)
```

1. What questions do you still have about methods in Ruby? __none at the moment, but excited to learn more complex use cases and using methods inside of methods.__
